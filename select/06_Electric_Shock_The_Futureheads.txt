Metal in my hand
It was the middle of winter
When the lights went out
I was swallowed by the darkness

When I got my electric shock
It knocked me off my feet
When I got my electric shock
It tasted bittersweet
I hit the deck and clenched my teeth
When I got my electric shock
I thought I was complete
When I got my electric shock
It knocked me off my feet

It came in through my head
Then the power pushed me down
I fell through the darkness
And my body hit the ground
I couldn't stop screaming
And I thought I might be head
I was racing on adrenaline
My pulse was thumping in my head

When I got my electric shock
It knocked me off my feet
When I got my electric shock
It tasted bittersweet
I hit the deck and clenched my teeth
When I got my electric shock
I thought I was complete
When I got my electric shock
It tasted bittersweet
I hit the deck and clenched my teeth

Then I had a déjà vu
And then I had a déjà vu
For 20 minutes everything was coming through so clear
And I could read your thoughts
And every word that they became
Was just a memory inside my brain

When I got my electric shock
It knocked me off my feet
When I got my electric shock
It tasted bittersweet
I hit the deck and clenched my teeth
When I got my electric shock
When I got my electric shock
When I got my electric shock
When I got my electric shock
When I got my electric shock
When I got my electric shock
