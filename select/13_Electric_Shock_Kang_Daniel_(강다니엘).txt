Electric shock, oh, oh, oh
Straight to my heart, oh, oh, oh
화들짝 놀라, wow
I gotta keep my hands up to the stars

끌려 저항 없이, oh
모든 회로가 끊겨
흘러드는 전류 느껴지는 전율
I really gotta wait for it, wait for it, oh
눈을 맞댄 순간 튀는 spark of light
흔들어 놔 내 맘속 core
잡힐 듯 말 듯 다시 멀어져가
But don't you try to take it too far

Just go with the flow
Step out of your zone

Electric shock, oh, oh, oh
Straight to my heart, oh, oh, oh
화들짝 놀라 wow
I gotta keep my hands up to the stars

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
Keep my hands up to the stars

Turn me up, 원해 everlasting
Light me up, 온몸에 도는 electric
처음 느낀 감정에 걸려버린 buffering
Gotta wait all for myself
내 맘을 자극하는 energy
번지는 기분, it's a code red
Go seize it for yourself
Keep your hands up to the stars

Just go with the flow
Step out of your zone

Electric shock, oh, oh, oh
Straight to my heart, oh, oh, oh
화들짝 놀라 wow
I gotta keep my hands up to the stars

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
Keep my hands up to the stars

머릿속 고민은 way too loud
볼륨은 줄이고 act right now
Electric shock, oh, oh, oh
Straight to my heart, oh, oh, oh

Electric shock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a-a
Electric shock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Electric shock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Electric shock, oh, oh, oh
Straight to my heart, oh, oh, oh
